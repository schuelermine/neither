# Neither-Data

Neither-Data provides the type Neither. It is a two-argument data type that ignores its arguments completely and has only one constructor.
It is a trivial instance of many typeclasses.  
This package also provides the `neither` function, which constructs a Neither from two type-matching objects, discarding them.
